In this post, I am sharing the different parameters to enable logging for General and Long running queries in MySQL.

Using shared approach, you don’t require to restart your MySQL Server. You can easily configure this log parameter, and you can see the output in Log table.

As a Database Administrator, it is our responsibility to log the all different kinds of queries because the log is our primary requirement for any troubleshooting.

First check the current status of the different Log Parameters:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%log%';

Using above statement, you can check the current value of log parameter.

Now enable logging for general query and save the output into “mysql.general_log” table:
SET GLOBAL log_output = 'TABLE';
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
SELECT *FROM mysql.general_log;

Now enable logging for long running queries:
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 1;
SET GLOBAL long_query_time= 1;
SET GLOBAL log_queries_not_using_indexes= ON;

Sometimes, it is required to execute the FLUSH command of the log to get immediate updates into the Log Table.

FLUSH LOGS;
