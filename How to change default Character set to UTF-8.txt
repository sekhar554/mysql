Sometimes, it requires changing the default character set of MySQL Server or MySQL Database.
A Character set “latin1” and Collation “latin1_swedish_ci” are the default of MySQL Server.

This is a standard configuration, and you do not need to change anything, but if your application requires storing data using a different character set, you have to change this default configuration.

Here, I am showing how to change your default character set and collation to UTF-8.

MySQL Server provides, different three ways to configure character set and collation.

Configure Character set and Collation at Database Level.
Configure Character set and Collation at Server Startup.
Configure Character set and Collation during MySQL Server Installation and Configuration.
First, check your default Character Set and Collation of MySQL Server.

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'chara%'; 
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'collation%';

If you want to change the default to UTF-8, you want to add the following to my.cnf (MySQL Configuration File).
[client]
default-character-set=utf8
 
[mysql]
default-character-set=utf8
 
[mysqld]
collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci
init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'
character-set-server = utf8

Specify Character Settings per Database:
CREATE DATABASE MyDatabase
DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8
DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
